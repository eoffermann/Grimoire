# Grimoire

The Unity package manager designed for rapid iteration, collaboration, and reuse — no matter what you build.

## What Is Grimoire?

Grimoire transforms Unity into a modular development ecosystem. Whether you’re crafting interactive simulations, AR/VR experiences, enterprise tools, or rapid prototypes, Grimoire makes it effortless to assemble, version, and share reusable code and assets across any number of projects.

## Why Choose Grimoire?

### 🚀 Speed Up Your Workflow  
Stop reinventing the wheel. Package your utilities, frameworks, and toolkits once — then pull them into new projects instantly. Spend your time innovating instead of copying and pasting boilerplate.

### 🔗 True Modularity  
Break monolithic Unity projects into self‑contained, versioned “Tomes.” Each Tome encapsulates everything it needs (scripts, assets, metadata) so you can build complex stacks of functionality without clutter.

### 📦 Automatic Dependency Management  
Declare dependencies in a simple manifest; Grimoire resolves and installs exactly what you need, in the correct version, every time. No more hidden requirements or mismatched versions slowing you down.

### 🤝 Team‑Friendly Collaboration  
Maintain a single source of truth for shared code. New team members onboard faster, code reviews become simpler, and merges stay conflict‑free — across any size team or distributed workflow.

### 🔄 Semantic Versioning Built In  
Track breaking changes, new features, and bug fixes with clear Major.Minor.Patch versioning. Easily roll forward or revert to stable releases, reducing integration risk.

### 🛠 Unity‑Native UX  
Fully integrated into the Unity Editor with intuitive configuration and loader windows. Manage manifests, inspect dependencies, and update packages without ever leaving your Unity project.
